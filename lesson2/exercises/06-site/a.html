	<h1>Adenosine</h1>

	<p>
	Adenosine is a purine nucleoside composed of a molecule of adenine
	attached to a ribose sugar molecule (ribofuranose) moiety via a
	β-N9-glycosidic bond. Derivatives of adenosine are widely found in
	nature and play an important role in biochemical processes, such as
	energy transfer—as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine
	diphosphate (ADP)—as well as in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine
	monophosphate (cAMP). Adenosine itself is a neuromodulator, believed to
	play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing arousal. Adenosine also
	plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through
	vasodilation.
