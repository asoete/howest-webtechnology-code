	<h1>Cytosine</h1>

	<p>
	 Cytosine (/ˈsaɪtəˌsiːn, -ˌziːn, -ˌsɪn/;C) is one of the four main
	 bases found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine
	 (uracil in RNA). It is a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic
	 aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at
	 position 4 and a keto group at position 2). The nucleoside of cytosine
	 is cytidine. In Watson-Crick base pairing, it forms three(3) hydrogen
	 bonds with guanine.
